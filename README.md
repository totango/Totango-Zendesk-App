Zendesk App for Totango
===============

This is the [Totango App](http://www.zendesk.com/apps/totango) for New Zendesk. The app displays user and account information right next to support tickets. It is available to all Zendesk accounts via the [app listing](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/totango-insights/). Please submit bug reports to [Totango](http://support.totango.com/).


How to run locally
===========
If you need to debug the app locally, you need to use the [Zendesk zat tool](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/zat).

Since the app uses secure settings, you need to run it again the insatlled app in the Totango Zendesk account. [See here](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/using_sdk#testing-an-app-with-secure-settings-locally) for details on how to do that.
